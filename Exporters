Prometheus exporter will export data from services like postgres db and rabbitmq or any service and label or adjust or frame prometheus understandanable 
format.

Prometheus use "pull mechanism"

Promql : to write queries in prometheus . Grafana will connect to prometheus from "promql" query at backend.

Majorly used prometheus for kubernetes and docker for monitoring

communication from grafan UI and prometheus using "promql" queries.

For each and every service you need to use exporter , it converts date to prometheus understandable fromat

if service deploy on "clusterip" you can port forward or expose over "nodeport" or "lb" to access on internet

-> kubectl port-forward deployment prometheus-grafana 3000

it expose over nodeport
